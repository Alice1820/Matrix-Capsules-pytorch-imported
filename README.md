# Matrix-Capsules-pytorch
a pytorch implementation of [Matrix Capsules with EM routing"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829)
This is now a very basic capsule implementation according to the paper.
In ```Capsule.py```, there are two implemented classes: ```PrimaryCaps``` and ```ConvCaps```.
The ClassCapsules in the paper is actually a special case of ```ConvCaps``` with whole receptive field, transformation matrix sharing and Coordinate Addition.

#TODO:
run this model on a dataset
